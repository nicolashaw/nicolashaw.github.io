## Second post
Today was a long and difficult day, but I did have some wins. 
My main objective was to finish Q3 of my assignment completely because it necessitates use of the lab computers.
I was able to collect all the data I needed for both the CPU and GPU, even though it took me a lot longer than I anticipated it would.
While the lab computers were computing I was able to write up my answer to Q5 of the assignment based on the research I completed yesterday.

Feeling okay about the rest of the assignment at this point :/
